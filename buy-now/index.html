                <h3>Step 1: Create a Wallet</h3>
                <p>Download Trust Wallet and create a wallet. Keep your phrase a secret! Never share it with anyone and store it properly! Make sure to copy the contract address below!</p>

                <p>IWA COIN Address</p>
                <p id="wallet-address">0x5f6beFe86080dDF5C464E42f30aD0cC4405B3C9C</p>
                <div class="buy-now-cta">
                    <button class="copy-btn" id="copy-btn" data-clipboard-action="copy" data-clipboard-target="#wallet-address" title="Copy to Clipboard">Copy Address</button>
                </div>

                <h3>Step 2: Add IWA Coin to the Wallet</h3>
                <p>Tap the icon in the top-right and search for "IWA Coin". If it's not there, tap "Add Custom Token".<br/> At the top, tap "Ethereum" next to Network, and change it to "Smart Chain". Copy the contract address on this page and put it in the
                    Contract Address box.<br/><br/> Next, put "IWA Coin" as the name, and the symbol as IWA. Decimals will be 18.<br/><br/> Click "Done" at the top and you should now have IWA Coin added to your wallet!
                </p>

                <h3>Step 3: Buy "Binance Smart Chain" (BSC)</h3>
                <p>Tap on "Smart Chain" on the main screen of Trust wallet, then tap "Buy" in the top right. This step may require KYC verification, so have documents ready to prove your identity.<br/><br/> If the transaction won't go through, you may need
                    to contact your bank to allow international transactions.
                    <br/><br/> After purchasing, there may be a delay while your transaction is processed. This is normal!
                </p>

                <h3>Step 4: Swap BSC for IWA Coin!</h3>
                <p>Once your transaction has been cleared, and you have BSC on your Trust Wallet, Go to DApps (or "Browser" for iPhones) at the bottom of the main screen. If the Browser button is not visible at the bottom for iPhone, open Safari and in the
                    URL type trust://browser_enable, then return to trust wallet.
                    <br/><br/> Open the DApps, or Browser, section and find PancakeSwap and open it. Connect your Trust Wallet in the top-right. Scroll down a little to the "Exchange" box Click the icon and set the slippage to 12%. If you want to give
                    it the best possible chance to clear, increase the deadline. By default it should be set to 20 minutes, which is fine.<br/><br/> Once the slippage is set, and you have the BNB amount set that you wish to swap for IWA Coin as shown,
                    just click Swap and wait patiently for the transaction to clear. This process may not be instant and can take anywhere from a few minutes up to an hour sometimes, depending on traffic. Once the transaction has been cleared, you should
                    have IWA Coin in your Trust Wallet!

                Accessibility and user-friendliness of IWA coin’s development are the features that make it very easy to use, even for the users who do not know cryptocurrencies well. Tokens can be easily and swiftly purchased via the IWA application or general trading
                sites. IWA coins can also be mined by IWA WiFi Smart Nodes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary targets for IWA coins are general stores, small shops in cities with access to the internet, and online games and applications that give away rewards that are looking for an exchange medium for buying, selling, and rewarding the app users
                in a way that doesn’t involve cash or time consuming and complex procedures at the bank.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding the marketing strategy, IWA Coin will use social media channels and member referral programs to gain recognition from more people. Soon, cash payment and cash withdrawal via debit card will also be available for members.

                <p>
                    Thus, we have introduced the IWA World WiFi campaign to give our members who own IWA coins unlimited use of the internet around the world. Members who own IWA coins can limitlessly use IWA World WiFi anywhere in the world with only one password.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Members who join the IWA WorldWiFi Smart Node network must purchase an IWA World WiFi smart mode Access Point device which costs 350 IWA.
                </p>

                <p>These devices will be used for mining.</p>
                <p>
                    You can use it by plugging the device in, connect it to the internet, and enter the member password.

                <p>
                    After that, you are ready for IWA coin mining. The IWX WorldWifi Smart Node can be purchased using the IWA App.

                <p>
                    Every member will receive IWA coins every hour as a reward. The number of the reward tokens depends on the number of users in that Node at that time.

            <p>
                Our IWA Coin developers initially began with the internet on TV Cable business. Then, after one year, we had developed the IPTV and VOIP system. And two years later, we offered the online mobile top-up service.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2016, we started to learn more about bitcoin mining and purchased numerous mining hardware from China to mine bitcoin. It was then that we have fallen in love with Cryptocurrency.
            </p>

            <p>
                From that moment on, we have been dedicating ourselves to researching and finding new Crypto mining techniques.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2019, we began selling online and promoting our businesses through every social platform. Then one day, we knew that the time has come and that we were ready. Thus, we have combined our experience in the last ten years to create the IWA Coin.
            </p>

            <p>
                This coin is a medium for buying, selling, and exchanging goods and currencies in online and offline environments worldwide. Moreover, we had invented a new token mining method using WiFi, which is easily accessible to the general public. This method
                has a low startup cost.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is also environmentally friendly, energy-efficient, and suitable for anyone interested in IWA Coin mining. With our experience in online sales and business promotion via social media, we have studied and utilized the referral program as our marketing
                strategy. This method can help IWA Coin grow swiftly and sustainably, making them accessible for various users.
            </p>

            <p>
                Numerous problems during our years of journey in the Crypto world were certainly precious lessons that had taught us to solve any problems correctly and properly. This is an essential part that will make the IWA Coin stand high on the 1st rank in the
                Crypto world in the future. “Comprehensive planning, long-term visions, confidence in every step”

                <p>
                  IWA coins were created on Binance smart chain (BSC) network to
                  be an option that functions faster and costs less than other
                  available payment platforms such as SWIFT.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was designed to support the
                  protocols that were developed on the Ethereum network.
                  Therefore, it can complete any transactions and transfer
                  tokens within a few minutes.
